###
LeakeyEditor is a simple text editor, scripted in Python, along with the Tkinter module. At the moment, this text editor is in its early stages and more features or functionalities will be added in the future.

## Requirements
* Python 3
* Tkinter

## KNOWN BUGS/ISSUES:
I encourage those who find any bugs or issues with the app to submit an "Issue" on this repository.
* "Save" works just like "Save As"

## TO-DO List:
* Implement Mouse-Click Actions
* Implement IDE Lines
* Implement regular savefile function
* Enable the canvas to fit all screen ratios.
* Add syntax highlighting (maybe)
